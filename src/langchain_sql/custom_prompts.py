DATABASE SCHEMA AND CONTEXT:
{table_description}

HIERARCHIES:
{hierarchy_info}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. ALWAYS exclude Mth = 'All' unless specifically requested for totals
2. For "achievement", calculate as (Actual/Target) * 100
3. For "YoY growth", calculate as ((Current - LastYear) / LastYear) * 100
4. Treat NULL values as 0 in calculations using COALESCE
5. Use NULLIF(denominator, 0) to avoid division by zero
6. When grouping data, always include relevant dimension columns in SELECT

BUSINESS VOCABULARY:
- "sales" typically means Primary Value (Prim_Value) unless specified
- "secondary sales" means Sec_Value
- "achievement" means actual vs target percentage
- "focus brands" means Status = 'FOCUS'
- "underperforming" means achievement < 100%
- "territory" refers to Terr_Code
- "TBM" means Territory Business Manager

AVAILABLE CALCULATED METRICS:
{chr(10).join(f"- {k}: {v.get('formula', 'No formula')}" for k, v in metrics.items() if 'formula' in v)}

Check for these common issues:

4. Is the business logic correct for the question asked?
5. Are column names correct according to the schema?
